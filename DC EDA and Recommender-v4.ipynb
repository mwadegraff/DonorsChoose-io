    "# Donors Choose\n",
    "Founded in 2000 by a Bronx history teacher, DonorsChoose.org has raised $685 million for America's classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.\n",
    "\n",
    "To date, 3 million people and partners have funded 1.1 million DonorsChoose.org projects. But teachers still spend more than a billion dollars of their own money on classroom materials. To get students what they need to learn, the team at DonorsChoose.org needs to be able to connect donors with the projects that most inspire them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second Kaggle Data Science for Good challenge, DonorsChoose.org, in partnership with Google.org, is inviting the community to help them pair up donors to the classroom requests that will most motivate them to make an additional gift. To support this challenge, DonorsChoose.org has supplied anonymized data on donor giving from the past five years. The winning methods will be implemented in DonorsChoose.org email marketing campaigns.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "DonorsChoose.org has funded over 1.1 million classroom requests through the support of 3 million donors, the majority of whom were making their first-ever donation to a public school. If DonorsChoose.org can motivate even a fraction of those donors to make another donation, that could have a huge impact on the number of classroom requests fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good solution will enable DonorsChoose.org to build targeted email campaigns recommending specific classroom requests to prior donors. Part of the challenge is to assess the needs of the organization, uncover insights from the data available, and build the right solution for this problem. Submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance - How well does the solution match donors to project requests to which they would be motivated to donate? DonorsChoose.org will not be able to live test every submission, so a strong entry will clearly articulate why it will be effective at motivating repeat donations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptable - The DonorsChoose.org team wants to put the winning submissions to work, quickly. Therefore a good entry will be easy to implement in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intelligible - A good entry should be easily understood by the DonorsChoose.org team should it need to be updated in the future to accommodate a changing marketplace."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "I will address the problem by using [Recommender System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) (RecSys) techniques. The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main RecSys techniques are:  \n",
    "   - [**Collaborative Filtering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering): This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.   \n",
    "   - [**Content-Based Filtering**](http://recommender-systems.org/content-based-filtering/): This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.  \n",
    "   - **Hybrid methods**:  Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem."

    "DonorsChoose.org has funded over 1.1 million classroom requests through the support of 3 million donors, the majority of whom were making their first-ever donation to a public school. If DonorsChoose.org can motivate even a fraction of those donors to make another donation, that could have a huge impact on the number of classroom requests fulfilled. A good solution will enable DonorsChoose.org to build targeted email campaigns recommending specific classroom requests to prior donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Strategy: Recommender systems (RecSys)\n",
    "\n",
    "I consider this task a recommender system (RecSys) problem. Donors are similar to users or customers of a online platform providing various products. Let's take a music site for example: when a user named Emma listened to one or more songs at our site, we will be able to recommend more songs to her based on her listening history and the listening history of people who are similar to her.  Similarly, once a donor named Alice donated to one or more projects at DonorsChoose.org, we will be able to recommend more projects to her based on her donation history and the donation history of other donors who are similar to her. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I propose the following three approaches to solve this problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content-Based Filtering**: This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the projects donors has previously donated to when modeling the donor's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend projects that are similar to those that a donor has donated to in the past.  In particular, various candidate projects are compared with projects the donor has donated to, and the best-matching projects will be recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collaborative Filtering**: This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the preference of a donor by collecting preferences from many other donors (collaborating). It predicts what a particular donor will donate to based on what projects other similar donors have donated to. The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if Alice and Bob have donated to the same project(s), Alice is more likely to share Bob's preference for a given project than that of a randomly chosen donor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hybrid methods**: Most companies like Netflix and Hulu use a hybrid approach in their recommendation models, which provide recommendation based on the combination of what content a user like in the past as well as what other similar user like. Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than both approaches in some cases. These hybrid methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem."
